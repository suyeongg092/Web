Over the past several years, there has been an exponential increase in cyberattacks, specifically targeting vulnerable links in critical software supply chains. These attacks disrupt the day-to-day functioning and threaten the security of nearly everyone on the internet, from billion-dollar companies and government agencies to hobbyist open-source developers. The ever-evolving threat of software supply chain attacks has garnered interest from the software industry and the US government in improving software supply chain security.
On September 20, 2024, three researchers from the NSF-backed Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 12 practitioners from 9 companies. The goals of the Summit were to: (1) to enable sharing between individuals from different companies regarding practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security, (2) to help form new collaborations, (3) to share our observations from our previous summits with industry, and (4) to learn about practitioners' challenges to inform our future research direction. The summit consisted of discussions of six topics relevant to the companies represented, including updating vulnerable dependencies, component and container choice, malicious commits, building infrastructure, large language models, and reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10538,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10538.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10538v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.10538
arXiv:2505.10430,The Ephemeral Threat: Assessing the Security of Algorithmic Trading Systems powered by Deep Learning,"Advije Rizvani, Giovanni Apruzzese, Pavel Laskov","We study the security of stock price forecasting using Deep Learning (DL) in computational finance. Despite abundant prior research on the vulnerability of DL to adversarial perturbations, such work has hitherto hardly addressed practical adversarial threat models in the context of DL-powered algorithmic trading systems (ATS). Specifically, we investigate the vulnerability of ATS to adversarial perturbations launched by a realistically constrained attacker. We first show that existing literature has paid limited attention to DL security in the financial domain, which is naturally attractive for adversaries. Then, we formalize the concept of ephemeral perturbations (EP), which can be used to stage a novel type of attack tailored for DL-based ATS. Finally, we carry out an end-to-end evaluation of our EP against a profitable ATS. Our results reveal that the introduction of small changes to the input stock prices not only (i) induces the DL model to behave incorrectly but also (ii) leads the whole ATS to make suboptimal buy/sell decisions, resulting in a worse financial performance of the targeted ATS.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10430,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10430.pdf,,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.10430
arXiv:2505.10349,Locally Differentially Private Frequency Estimation via Joint Randomized Response,"Ye Zheng, Shafizur Rahman Seeam, Yidan Hu, Rui Zhang, Yanchao Zhang","Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing a strong theoretical guarantee of data privacy to data contributors against an untrusted data collector. Under a typical LDP scheme, each data contributor independently randomly perturbs their data before submitting them to the data collector, which in turn infers valuable statistics about the original data from received perturbed data. Common to existing LDP mechanisms is an inherent trade-off between the level of privacy protection and data utility in the sense that strong data privacy often comes at the cost of reduced data utility. Frequency estimation based on Randomized Response (RR) is a fundamental building block of many LDP mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Randomized Response (JRR) mechanism based on correlated data perturbations to achieve locally differentially private frequency estimation. JRR divides data contributors into disjoint groups of two members and lets those in the same group jointly perturb their binary data to improve frequency-estimation accuracy and achieve the same level of data privacy by hiding the group membership information in contrast to the classical RR mechanism. Theoretical analysis and detailed simulation studies using both real and synthetic datasets show that JRR achieves the same level of data privacy as the classical RR mechanism while improving the frequency-estimation accuracy in the overwhelming majority of the cases by up to two orders of magnitude.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10349,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10349.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10349v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.10349

We conduct a review of related work, identifying best practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT. We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20.

BLS aggregate signatures are a popular kind of aggregate signature, deployed by Ethereum, Dfinity, and Cloudflare amongst others, currently undergoing standardization at the IETF. However, BLS aggregate signatures are difficult to use correctly, with nuanced requirements that must be carefully handled by protocol developers.
In this work, we design the first models of aggregate signatures that enable formal verification tools, such as Tamarin and ProVerif, to be applied to protocols using these signatures. We introduce general models that are based on the cryptographic security definition of generic aggregate signatures, allowing the attacker to exploit protocols where the security requirements are not satisfied. We also introduce a second family of models formalizing BLS aggregate signatures in particular. We demonstrate our approach's practical relevance by modelling and analyzing in Tamarin a device attestation protocol called SANA.

However, their deployment in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises significant privacy concerns, primarily due to the centralized processing of sensitive user data. Private Transformer Inference (PTI) offers a solution by utilizing cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, enabling inference while preserving both user data and model privacy. This paper reviews recent PTI advancements, highlighting state-of-the-art solutions and challenges.

arXiv:2505.10273,AttentionGuard: Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection for Secure Vehicular Platoons,"Hexu Li, Konstantinos Kalogiannis, Ahmed Mohamed Hussain, Panos Papadimitratos","Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state (no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant, gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers. Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider threats.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10273,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10273.pdf,,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.10273

Nair","Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) has emerged as a robust framework for mitigating RowHammer (RH) vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems. However, we uncover a critical vulnerability: a timing channel introduced by the Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol and Refresh Management (RFM) commands. We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies.
To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10111,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10111.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10111v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.10111

We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning methodologies.

With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently rather rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 70 devices spanning 36 brands and 8 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overally perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 20/35 devices improperly conduct certificate validation, and 5/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09929,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09929.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.09929v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.09929
arXiv:2505.09928,DeFeed: Secure Decentralized Cross-Contract Data Feed in Web 3.0 for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Xingchen Sun, Runhua Xu, Wei Ni, Li Duan, Chao Li","Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs.

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.

Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods.

arXiv:2505.09843,Automated Alert Classification and Triage (AACT): An Intelligent System for the Prioritisation of Cybersecurity Alerts,"Melissa Turcotte, François Labrèche, Serge-Olivier Paquette","Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited visibility into business processes.
A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats. The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign alerts.
Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Applications (stat.AP),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09843,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09843.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.09843v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.09843
arXiv:2505.09743,Guardian Positioning System (GPS) for Location Based Services,"Wenjie Liu, Panos Papadimitratos","Location-based service (LBS) applications proliferate and support transportation, entertainment, and more. Modern mobile platforms, with smartphones being a prominent example, rely on terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for correct positioning. However, they are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate positions to control and undermine LBS functionality -- thus enabling the scamming of users or services. Our work reveals that GNSS spoofing attacks succeed even though smartphones have multiple sources of positioning information. Moreover, that Wi-Fi spoofing attacks with GNSS jamming are surprisingly effective. More concerning is the evidence that sophisticated, coordinated spoofing attacks are highly effective. Attacks can target GNSS in combination with other positioning methods, thus defenses that assume that only GNSS is under attack cannot be effective. More so, resilient GNSS receivers and special-purpose antennas are not feasible on smartphones. To address this gap, we propose an extended receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework that leverages the readily available, redundant, often so-called opportunistic positioning information on off-the-shelf platforms. We jointly use onboard sensors, terrestrial infrastructures, and GNSS. We show that our extended RAIM framework improves resilience against location spoofing, e.g., achieving a detection accuracy improvement of up to 24-58% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms and location providers; detecting attacks within 5 seconds, with a low false positive rate.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09743,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09743.pdf,https://arxiv.org/html/2505.09743v1,https://arxiv.org/format/2505.09743
arXiv:2505.10500,Quantized Approximate Signal Processing (QASP): Towards Homomorphic Encryption for audio,"Tu Duyen Nguyen, Adrien Lesage, Clotilde Cantini, Rachid Riad","Audio and speech data are increasingly used in machine learning applications such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and mental health monitoring. However, the passive collection of this data by audio listening devices raises significant privacy concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution by enabling computations on encrypted data and preserving user privacy. Despite its potential, prior attempts to apply FHE to audio processing have faced challenges, particularly in securely computing time frequency representations, a critical step in many audio tasks.
Here, we addressed this gap by introducing a fully secure pipeline that computes, with FHE and quantized neural network operations, four fundamental time-frequency representations: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel filterbanks, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and gammatone filters. Our methods also support the private computation of audio descriptors and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Besides, we proposed approximate STFT algorithms that lighten computation and bit use for statistical and machine learning analyses.
We ran experiments on the VocalSet and OxVoc datasets demonstrating the fully private computation of our approach. We showed significant performance improvements with STFT approximation in private statistical analysis of audio markers, and for vocal exercise classification with CNNs. Our results reveal that our approximations substantially reduce error rates compared to conventional STFT implementations in FHE. We also demonstrated a fully private classification based on the raw audio for gender and vocal exercise classification.

However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse, non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA, that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios, including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices. Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task.

In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients' data.

We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes.

However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety.
